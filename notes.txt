by the way, this version is riddeled with errors nothing cattastrophic like as not running
the application or not building the apk file but the tflite plugin is outdated as 
it does not seem to support the new latest v2 embedding for the android application.
anyway that's it, btw there is another olugin the is supposed to be latest for tflite called 
tflite_flutter package but I dunno how to use it for now, 
So for now this is it I guess.
oh and the button are made with old way, just wanted to try the old way.
